This document provides information about configuration of the 4TRESS RADIUS 
front end (rlm_ftress). To successfully configure or change the configuration
of rlm_ftress, the user/administrator needs to setup 3 configurations files:
   /opt/4TRESS_RFE/etc/raddb/radiusd.conf
   /opt/4TRESS_RFE/etc/raddb/clients.conf	
   /opt/4TRESS_RFE/etc/raddb/users




file: /opt/4TRESS_RFE/etc/raddb/radiusd.conf
This file provides the main configuration for the 4TRESS RADIUS front end (rlm_ftress).

'ftress' needs to be added to the 'authenticate' part of this file, like:

authenticate {

	ftress

}

And there needs to be a 'ftress' subsection in the 'modules' section of this file:

modules {

	ftress {
	       use_ssl = yes
	       
	       # etc.
	}

}    

Detailed description of valid configuration settings follows:

use_ssl
   type: boolean	
   default: yes
   description: this setting controls what protocol is going to be used in communication
   		between rlm_ftress and 4TRESS server. (use_ssl = yes means SSL/HTTPS,
		use_ssl = no means HTTP)

admin_authentication_type_code
   type: string
   default:
   description: Unique identifier of the 4TRESS authentication type that contains the
   		endusers authentication statistics. rlm_ftress uses this to reset the
		failure count of the 4TRESS users authenticator (device or username/password pair)
		if a successful forwarded authentication is used.
		
server_authentication_type_code
   type: string
   default:
   description: Unique identifier of the 4TRESS authentication type that rlm_ftress uses
   		to authenticate itself to 4TRESS.

server_channel  
   type: string
   default:
   description: 4TRESS channel that rlm_ftress uses to authenticate itself to 4TRESS.

server_username
   type: string
   default: n/a
   description: The username used by rlm_ftress module to authenticate itself to a 4TRESS server.

server_password
   type: string
   default: n/a
   description: The password used by rlm_ftress module to authenticate itself to a 4TRESS server.

user_channel
   type: string
   default:
   description: 4TRESS channel used by the end users when they authenticate themselves through 
   		rlm_ftress.

user_authentication_type_code
   type: string
   default:
   description: Unique identifier of the 4TRESS authentication type used by end users.

security_domain
   type: string
   default:
   description: The 4TRESS security domain that contains the end users that will be authenticating
   		through rlm_ftress.

endpoint_authenticator
endpoint_authenticator_manager
endpoint_device_manager
   type: string (URL)
   default: n/a
   description: Endpoints are the URLs of different 4TRESS SOAP web services.

radius_username_mapping
   type: int
   default: 0
   description: This setting controls how to interpret the 'username' value from the RADIUS request.
   		Currently 2 mappings are supported: 0 meaning that the value is interpreted as username,
		1 meaning that the value is to be interpreted as a device serial number.

forward_authentication_mode
   type: boolean
   default: no
   description: This setting enables forwarding of authentication requests to a 3rd party RADIUS server.
   		Some clients have been already using some RADIUS server, this setting allows to forward
		authentication requests that didn't succeed against 4TRESS to a 3rd party RADIUS server.
		This feature exists mainly to support migration from a 3rd party RADIUS servers to 
		4TRESS. 

   forward_authentication_server
      type: IP address
      default: n/a
      description: IP address (IPv4) of the 3rd party RADIUS server 
      		   (example: forward_authentication_server = 192.168.1.22) 

   forward_authentication_port
      type: integer
      default: 1812
      description: Port number of the 3rd party RADIUS server

   forward_authentication_secret
      type: string
      default: n/a
      description: The shared secret to be used between the 3rd party RADIUS server and its clients.
      		   From 3rd party RADIUS server rlm_ftress is just a RADIUS client.



file: /opt/4TRESS_RFE/etc/raddb/clients.conf
      This file defines what clients (IP addresses) are going to be allowed to connect to 
      the RADIUS front end (rlm_ftress).

file: /opt/4TRESS_RFE/etc/raddb/users
      In this file the 'DEFAULT Auth-Type' needs to be set to ftress: 
      DEFAULT	Auth-Type = ftress
